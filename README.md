# Some Simple Chatbot and LLM Usage Examples for the Artificial Intelligence Class

- Some of the topics covered are:
    - Natural Language Processing examples and why it is important (NLP)
    - How to teach a chatbot using the ChatterBot library
    - A simple example of prompt engineering
- All examples use free LLMs
- The comments in the header files list the dependencies that should be installed to run on platforms like Google Colab
- Some folders have their own README files and also a requirements file, but it is better to stick with the dependencies listed in the header (the requirements files may be updated or removed in the future)
- There is a basic chatbot with database interaction, and also "text-to-task" operations, located at: `\Chatbot\ChatterBot\ChatbotNLP\nlp_e_pre_processors.py`
- All chatbots here mostly use the frameworks/platforms/models below:
    - ChatterBot: https://docs.chatterbot.us/
    - spaCy: https://spacy.io/
    - Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/
